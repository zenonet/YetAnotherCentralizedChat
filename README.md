# Yet Another Centralized Chat

Yet Another Centralized Chat is a chat platform I developed for fun. It's based on a postgresql database, a minimal C#/aspnet REST API and an Avalonia UI C# client GUI.

## Try it out

To try it out, download the client from the release panel and run it. It allows you to register/login. From there, just register and write to another user (like a friend who registered as well or a second instance of the client)
